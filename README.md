## Installation

#### Prerequisites
- [An AWS account](https://aws.amazon.com/)
- [AWS CLI](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/userguide/installing.html)
- [Golang](https://golang.org/doc/install)
- [Docker](https://docs.docker.com/install)
- [SAM CLI](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/serverless-application-model/latest/developerguide/serverless-sam-cli-install-mac.html)


Clone or [go get](https://golang.org/doc/articles/go_command.html) the files locally
```shell script
go get github.com/mrz1818/codepipeline-to-github
cd $GOPATH/src/github.com/mrz1818/codepipeline-to-github
```

<details>
<summary><strong><code>Setup to run locally</code></strong></summary>

**1)** Modify the [event json](events/started-event.json) to a recent pipeline execution and pipeline name
```json
"detail": {
  "pipeline": "your-pipeline-name",
  "execution-id": "some-execution-id"
}
```

**2)** Modify the [local-env.json](local-env.json) file with your Github Personal Access Token
```json
"StatusFunction": {
  "GITHUB_ACCESS_TOKEN": "your-token-goes-here"
}
``` 

**3)** Finally, run the handler which should produce `null` as a success
```shell script
make run event="started"
``` 
</details>

## Deployment & Hosting
This repository has CI integration using [AWS CodePipeline](https://aws.amazon.com/codepipeline/).

Deploying to the `master` branch will automatically start the process of shipping the code to [AWS Lambda](https://aws.amazon.com/lambda/).

Any changes to the environment via the [AWS CloudFormation template](application.yaml) will be applied.
The actual build process can be found in the [buildspec.yml](buildspec.yml) file.

The application relies on [AWS Secrets Manager](https://aws.amazon.com/secrets-manager/) and [SSM](https://aws.amazon.com/systems-manager/features/) to store environment variables.

<details>
<summary><strong><code>Create Environment Keys (AWS)</code></strong></summary>

> If you already have KMS keys for encrypting environment variables, you can skip this step.

**1)** Create a [`KMS Key` in your console](https://console.aws.amazon.com/kms/home?region=us-east-1#/kms/keys) per `<stage>` for your application(s):
```text
Example:
name = "<stage>EnvironmentVars"
description = "Encryption key for <stage> environment variables"
```

**2)** Store the [`KMS Key ID`](https://console.aws.amazon.com/kms/home?region=us-east-1#/kms/keys) in [SSM](https://aws.amazon.com/systems-manager/features/) for global use
```shell script
make save-param param_name="/<stage>/global/kms_key_id" param_value="YOUR_KMS_KEY_ID"
```
</details>

<details>
<summary><strong><code>Create New Hosting Environment (AWS)</code></strong></summary>

<img src=".github/IMAGES/infrastructure-diagram.png" alt="infrastructure diagram" height="400" />

This will create a new [AWS CloudFormation](https://aws.amazon.com/cloudformation/) stack with:
- (1) [Lambda](https://aws.amazon.com/lambda/) Function(s)
- (1) [CloudWatch Event Rule](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonCloudWatch/latest/events/Create-CloudWatch-Events-Rule.html) to subscribe to Pipeline events
- (1) [CloudWatch LogGroups](https://aws.amazon.com/cloudwatch/) for Lambda Function(s)
- (1) [CodePipeline](https://aws.amazon.com/codepipeline/) with multiple stages to deploy the application from Github
- (1) [CodePipeline Webhook](https://aws.amazon.com/codepipeline/) to receive Github notifications from a specific `branch:name`
- (1) [CodeBuild Project(s)](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/codebuild/latest/userguide/create-project.html) to test, build and deploy the app
- (2) [Service Roles](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/id_roles_create_for-service.html) for working with CodeBuild and CodePipeline

**NOTE:** Requires an existing S3 bucket for artifacts and sam-cli deployments (located in the [Makefile](Makefile))

The `Github token` is stored encrypted for use in Lambda (decrypted at runtime via [KMS](https://aws.amazon.com/kms/).
To be able to decrypt the `token` at runtime, the Lambda function will need permission to 
access the KMS Key with the KeyID specified in SSM: `/<stage>/global/kms_key_id`

**1)** Add your Github personal access token _(Only once per stage)_
```shell script
make save-token token="YOUR_GITHUB_TOKEN"  kms_key_id="YOUR_KMS_KEY_ID"  APPLICATION_STAGE_NAME="<stage>"
```

**2)** One command will build, test, package and deploy the application to AWS. 
After initial deployment, updating the function is as simple as committing to Github.
```shell script
make deploy
```

_(Example)_ Customized deployment for another stage/branch
```shell script
make deploy APPLICATION_STAGE_NAME="development" REPO_BRANCH="development"
``` 

If you make any adjustments to the command above, update the [buildspec](buildspec.yml) file accordingly.  
</details>

<details>
<summary><strong><code>Tear Down Hosting Environment (AWS)</code></strong></summary>

Remove the Stack(s)
```shell script
make teardown
```   
</details>

<details>
<summary><strong><code>Lambda Logging</code></strong></summary>

View all the logs in [AWS CloudWatch](https://console.aws.amazon.com/cloudwatch/home?region=us-east-1#logsV2:log-groups) via log groups:
```text
/aws/lambda/<app_name>-<stage_name>-<function_name>
```
</details>

## Documentation
The [`status`](status.go) handler is composed of:
```text
- Processes incoming CloudWatch events from CodePipeline
- Decrypts environment variables (Github Token)
- Gets the latest information from CodePipeline via an ExecutionID
- Determine the Github status based on the Execution status
- Post request to Github to notify the status change
``` 

Run the status function with different [events](events)
```shell script
make run event="failed"
``` 

<details>
<summary><strong><code>Library Deployment</code></strong></summary>

[goreleaser](https://github.com/goreleaser/goreleaser) for easy binary or library deployment to Github and can be installed via: `brew install goreleaser`.

The [.goreleaser.yml](.goreleaser.yml) file is used to configure [goreleaser](https://github.com/goreleaser/goreleaser).

Use `make release-snap` to create a snapshot version of the release, and finally `make release` to ship to production.
